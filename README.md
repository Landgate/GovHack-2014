GovHack-2014
============

Resources for developers in GovHack 2014.

This is currentl a placeholder page to support Landgate's new SLIP services for GovHack 2014. More content will be added closer to GovHack 2014 in July.

The resources supporting the [Unearthed Hackathon](https://github.com/Landgate/Unearthed) are quite similar and will give you an idea of how you can use our new SLIP platform in your GovHack project.
